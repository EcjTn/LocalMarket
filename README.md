# 🛒 Local Marketplace Backend

This is an **ongoing** backend project for a local marketplace, built using **Express.js** and **PostgreSQL**.

## 🔐 Features

- Login and signup using **JWT-based authentication**
- **Google reCAPTCHA** check to avoid bots
- Three user roles:
  - **Buyer**
  - **Seller**
  - **Admin**
- Uses **PostgreSQL** as the database
- Simple one-page **HTML form** to test registration process with recaptcha

## 📌 Notes

This project is still being worked on.  
I'll try to update it when I have free time.
